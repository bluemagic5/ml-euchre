# Task List for ML-Euchre
Group Members: Choi, Horner, Hoendorf

## Task 1: Primary - Horner

Teach Euchre gameplay and strategy to other group members.

## Task 2: Primary - Hoendorf

Research other implementations of machine-learning-based Euchre/card playing algorithms.

## Task 3: Primary - Hoendorf

Investigate the best tools for implementing the algorithm (e.g. language, packagaes, database, neural network).

## Task 4: Primary - Horner

Develop a rules engine to govern Euchre gameplay (for both the algorithm and user).

## Task 5: Primary - Choi

Design a user interface to interact with computer player(s).

## Task 6: Primary - Horner

Obtain training data to initially model gameplay decision making.

## Task 7: Primary - Hoendorf

Determine the best model based on the accuracy of AI gameplay. Information gathered during Task 2 and 3 would lend to this task.

## Task 8: Primary - Choi

Test the model either manually through play or monitor the AI as it plays against itself.

## Task 9: Primary - Horner

Refine the model based on gameplay data collected and by comparing/contrasting different configurations.

## Task 10: Primary - Choi

Demonstrate usage of the UI and present our findings.
