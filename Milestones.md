## Develop User Interface

Have an interface developed so that we can display the algorithm playing the game.

**Deliverables:**
A working interface

## Setup Initial Rules Engine

Have a set of game rules that governs what the program can and can't do.

**Deliverables:**
Logic that defines the game's rules

## Obtain Training Data

**Deliverables:**
The algorithm.

## Create Final Project Presentation

Make the public presentation that will be used to show what our project is and what we did.

**Deliverables:**
A visual display of the project.
