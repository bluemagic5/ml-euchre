# Professional Biography for Aaron Choi
I am a Fifth year Computer Science Major at the University of Cincinnati. I have worked on a Javascript app to extract an mp3 file from any youtube video as a personal project. I have also attended UC hackathons since 2014. I worked on multiple projects, such as an app for a sort of Uber but for people who want to get food delivered to them, a collaborative coding platform(think google docs but working with code), and even a simple Pebble game app.

# Co-op Work Experience
## *Spring 2015*
I worked on a dashboard for an internal web app named CloudRunner used by Siemens PLM Software development teams. I used J2EE technologies, HTML and CSS, Java, JavaScript, and Tomcat to develop the dashboard.
## *Fall 2015*
I worked on implementing the ability to run multiple test suites in CloudRunner. Developers would be able to check off a list of test suites they wanted to run and save time by working on other tasks while tests were running. I used FTP/SSH, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, XML, and more. During this time, I also played a vital role in the company hackathon. I had knowledge on CloudRunner and helped to develop a mock up for an idea that involved restructuring the automated test suites.
## *Summer 2016*
I worked on testing various functionalities in Active Workspace, a product of Siemens PLM Software. During this time, I wrote Cucumber feature files to automate testing. I was leading the way for other QA team members as I was the first one to start automating the tests. I wrote the step definitions behind the feature files in Java. I gained communication skills as I was now part of a Scrum team.
## *Spring 2017*
I worked on more cucumber feature files and had to write more extensive feature files. I read more on Selenium and helped other full time QA employees learn Cucumber. I worked more hands on with HTML and JavaScript and grew more professionally.
## *Summer 2017*
I helped design additional testing infrastructure for an internal app called the Deployment Center. This deploys, manages, and maintains multiple versions of software in multiple Teamcenter environments. I learned more about the Teamcenter product by running scripts and examining the structure of the product. I learned to communicate better and more clearly as well. I also went to the company hackathon to integrate Slack with NX, which were products I had never touched.
# Project Sought
I think an ideal project for me is something that can be achieved and then expanded upon if time permits. I am up for anything web based.
