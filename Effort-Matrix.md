| 1        | Teach Euchre gameplay and strategy to other group members.                                                                       |80%             |10%              |10%          |
| 2        | Research other implementations of machine-learning-based Euchre/card playing algorithms.                                         |30%             |40%              |30%          |
| 3        | Investigate the best tools for implementing the algorithm (e.g. language, packagaes, database, neural network).                  |20%             |60%              |20%          |
| 4        | Develop a rules engine to govern Euchre gameplay (for both the algorithm and user).                                              |40%             |40%              |20%          |
| 5        | Design a user interface to interact with computer player(s).                                                                     |10%             |10%              |80%          |
| 6        | Obtain training data to initially model gameplay decision making.                                                                |40%             |30%              |30%          |
| 7        | Determine the best model based on the accuracy of AI gameplay. Information gathered during Task 2 and 3 would lend to this task. |25%             |50%              |25%          |
| 8        | Test the model either manually through play or monitor the AI as it plays against itself.                                        |30%             |30%              |40%          |
| 9        | Refine the model based on gameplay data collected and by comparing/contrasting different configurations.                         |40%             |30%              |30%          |
| 10       | Demonstrate usage of the UI and present our findings.                                                                            |30%             |30%              |40%          |
