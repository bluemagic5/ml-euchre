| 1        | Teach Euchre gameplay and strategy to other group members.                                                                       | Horner   |09/01/2017  |11/01/2017|
| 2        | Research other implementations of machine-learning-based Euchre/card playing algorithms.                                         | Hoendorf |09/08/2017  |12/01/2017|
| 3        | Investigate the best tools for implementing the algorithm (e.g. language, packagaes, database, neural network).                  | Hoendorf |09/08/2017  |12/01/2017|
| 4        | Develop a rules engine to govern Euchre gameplay (for both the algorithm and user).                                              | Horner   |11/01/2017  |12/20/2017|
| 5        | Design a user interface to interact with computer player(s).                                                                     | Choi     |02/01/2017  |04/01/2017|
| 6        | Obtain training data to initially model gameplay decision making.                                                                | Horner   |10/27/2017  |11/20/2017|
| 7        | Determine the best model based on the accuracy of AI gameplay. Information gathered during Task 2 and 3 would lend to this task. | Hoendorf |09/08/2017  |02/01/2017|
| 8        | Test the model either manually through play or monitor the AI as it plays against itself.                                        | Choi     |02/01/2017  |04/01/2017|
| 9        | Refine the model based on gameplay data collected and by comparing/contrasting different configurations.                         | Horner   |02/01/2017  |04/01/2017|
| 10       | Demonstrate usage of the UI and present our findings.                                                                            | Choi     |04/01/2017  |05/01/2017|
