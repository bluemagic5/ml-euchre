## Description
An implementation of machine learning for a system that can teach itself how to play the card game Euchre.

## Project Problem Statement
Euchre is a complicated game and we want use machine learning to teach a machine how to learn Euchre. This way a human can practice playing vs an entity that "learns" like a human to hone their skills as it can be hard to get four people together to practice the game. 


## Inadequacy of current solutions
Sure there are plenty of AI that can play Euchre but how many of them can really play like a human? Mistakes are essential to humanity and currently AI can't really simulate mistakes. Our machine learning algorithm will simulate a human that learns and adapts according to plays(including mistakes).

### Background Skills/Interests to the Problem
* Interest in machine learning
* Interest in card games

### Approach and Goals
* Become familiar with euchre's rules and processes
* Develop those rules and processes into the project
* Create an algorithm that plays the game
* Create rules that can quantify the performance of the algorithm
* Run the program and let it teach itself to play
* Have an AI that can play competitively against human players
