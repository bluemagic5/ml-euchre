# Logging

If you choose to log a game when you run `Euchre.py` two different files will be created: the detailed log and the overview log. They will be created with a timestamp following the format `YYYYMMDD_HHmmss` and with a prefix of either `detail` or `overview`; this ensures that the names of each log are unique. You can then import the log anywhere you could import a `.csv` file.
