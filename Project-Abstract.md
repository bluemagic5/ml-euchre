# Abstract:
For this project, we are implementing an algorithm that is able to learn the card game Euchre through machine learning (ML) models. The algorithm would most likely incorporate an artificial neural network paired with reinforcement learning, and would be able to play itself to learn over time. One possible model for decisions would be a Monte Carlo Decision Tree (MCDT) where each decision is driven by choosing the optimal state of all possible states, where optimality is determined by the probability of winning a trick, round, and/or the game. Specific techniques and environments would require further exploration, however. The desired end-product is artificial intelligence (AI), embedded into a graphical user interface (GUI), that is able to successfully play against a human.
