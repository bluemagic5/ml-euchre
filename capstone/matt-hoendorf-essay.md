For this project, we will attempt to implement an algorithm that is able to learn the card game Euchre through machine learning (ML). The algorithm would incorporate an artificial neural network and would be able to play itself to learn over time. The environment would most likely utilize reinforcement learning, where the “reward” would be winning a trick, round, and/or game. Specific techniques and environments would require further exploration, however. The desired end-product is artificial intelligence (AI), embedded into a graphical user interface (GUI), that is able to successfully play against a human.

Several courses I have taken throughout my tenure at UC will provide a foundation for the learning and work for the project ahead. Database Design, Design & Analysis of Algorithms, Intelligent Data Analysis, and Machine Learning are among those that I feel are most important. DB design will help with the premilinary setups for the data that we will be collecting and storing. Algorithms will help us determine the best algorithmic approaches and designs while we consider speed and complexity. IDA and Machine Learning both touch on ML and approaches to different types of ML problems, which will help us with the AI component. Aside from these CS curriculum course, Technical Writing, though not inherently technical, will also lend to the documentation and reports that will need to be done during and after development.

My co-op experience will also provide a background of skills required for this project, not just from a technical standpoint but from a professional one as well. I've co-oped at a market research firm, ORC International, for the past two and a half years. My primary function is data ETL and management. I work with MS SQL databases and use Python with the pydata stack to automate processes. There are a plethora of Python modules and packages that allow you to easily manipulate data and train ML models, something we are going to pursue for this project. Beyond technical expertise, ORC provided me with experience in project managment, communication, and team-based activities that will allow me to work more effectively with my group.
