This project is academically about learning machine learning. We came up with the idea of using Euchre as a way to apply our findings. Euchre is fairly straightforward and applying machine learning to it will challenge our academic prowess. This will be a very fun and exciting experience as we delve into a subject that we have never touched before. Machine learning is a relatively new technology and is rapidly evolving, especially with the breakthrough of Google's AlphaGo. This will undoubtedly make our group distinguished in that we are working in a field that has lots of room to expand.

Computer Science I(CS 1021C) definitely laid down the groundwork in my Computer Science career. By learning about the basics of programming, I will have an easier time learning other programming languages. Another class AI (5133) might also prove useful in the endeavor for machine learning. I believe that the AI class might have some overlap since they are closely related. I learned about the theory behind AI and how to program basic AI's. With these two classes, I hope to contribute significantly to machine learning with euchre.

Another important piece of my college experience is my co-op experience. I learned the Agile process, which could be very useful when developing this project. We might use the agile method to be very efficient and organized. I also learned the value of communication. We must make sure to be transparent with each other so that there will be no confusion and the project will go smoothly. I am confident that my co-op experience will be invaluable to the team project.

My motivation for being part of this project is that I wanted to challenge myself. I want to be able to show that I am not afraid to delve into new uncharted territory. Machine learning seems very daunting to the average person and I want to prove that I can take the challenge head on. I also did not know how to play euchre before the project and had always been curious. I now know how to play euchre and will work towards our goal of teaching a machine how to play euchre. 

Our preliminary approach will be to program the rules and interface for the game.  We will then have to get a learning algorithm implemented. The results I expect will be an AI that has learned euchre at a competitive level. This means it should be able to challenge highly skilled players. We will know when we are done when the machine wins consistently. We will know if we did a good job when the machine beats us almost all the time.
